# Paper-Plane-flying-distance
STA305 (Experimental Design) Group Project

## Project Overview
- Controlled Experiment was carried out to check the effect of the type of paper on the flying distance
- 3 types of paper planes (Gift wrapping paper, lined paper, printing paper) were used in the experiment
- The Average distance travelled by different papers was found to be not significantly different
- R code used for the analysis is included in the appendix of the report
